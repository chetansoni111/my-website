It promotes and supports innovative activities aimed at population stabilization by partnering with government and civil society.</p>
<p>Ms K. Sujatha Rao, Secretary, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India was the chief guest at this conference and she delivered the Key-note Address.</p>
<p>The conference was attended by leading experts in the area of health and population who shared their experiences with the audience and discussed the way forward. The conference also has participation of health officials from all the major northern states.</p>
<p>Population growth has long been a concern of the government of India has a lengthy history of explicit population policy. The Government began its efforts in as early as 1950 and India was one of the pioneer nations in the developing world to have government sponsored family planning efforts. As we can see from the literature, all governments in India irrespective of their political affiliation has addressed this problem aggressively and have devoted tremendous efforts and resources for the last 60 years in this area. The government has long back recognized that the stabilization of the population is not a stand alone issue but is an integral part of general human development strategy which takes into account social, health and educational conditions. Despite the numerous resources deployed for health and development, India continued to have one of the most rapidly growing population in the world. We were just 350 million at the time of independence and now increased to 1.15 billion. Our expected population in 2030 will be 1.53 billion, which will be the largest in the world of a single country.</p>
<p>This forum was&nbsp;an excellent opportunity for various government officers and member corporates from the national level and the states of UP, MP, Bihar, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Assam and Orissa to join in the deliberations and to understand the issues related to Population Stabilisation in the country. They also have an opportunity to interact with health officers from the states to discuss the way forward in their states and areas of possible collaboration. The issue of Population, Health and Development, is not limited to the health sector alone. It impacts all aspects of development and the economic development of the country at large and therefore would be a cause of concern and interest for all members. The Conference was well attended by 140 delegates from all over India.</p>

                     <p>Foundation’s&nbsp;<strong>16th Round Table Conference on</strong>&nbsp;<strong>"Improving Access to Health Care : Reaching the Unreached"</strong>&nbsp;was held at India International, Centre, New Delhi on November 11, 2005. The theme of the conference is a great national importance. Over seventy percent of the country’s population resides in the rural areas. Unfortunately medical infrastructure, facilities, resources and specialist doctors are available in big towns and big cities. Women and children residing in the rural areas have the most difficult access to healthcare and at the same time the greatest need for it. These areas face high infant and maternal mortality rates. Awareness levels about antenatal care, diarrhoea, pneumonia, TB, STDs, HIV/AIDS are very low. People very often fall prey to the unsafe medical practices by the unqualified quacks and birth attendants. The aim of this Round Table Conference was to consider restructuring of the present health delivery system, eliminate financial barriers and explore the possibility of new technologies like telemedicine to reach out to the rural India to provide quality health care to the masses. A number of eminent speakers from various reputed medical institutes like AIIMS, Maulana Azad Medical College, Delhi, PGI, Chandigarh, USAID, Tata and other prominent NGOs deliberated on various topics related to the health delivery system. In the end of the conference, frontline messages were delivered to give directions to the policy makers in the government so as to consider new ideas for making the health care system cost effective, convenient and accessible to all. The conference was well attended by 150 participants from all over India.</p>

<p>The conference was attended by leading experts in the area of health and population who shared their experiences with the audience and discussed the way forward. The conference also has participation of health officials from all the major northern states.</p>
<p>Population growth has long been a concern of the government of India has a lengthy history of explicit population policy. The Government began its efforts in as early as 1950 and India was one of the pioneer nations in the developing world to have government sponsored family planning efforts. As we can see from the literature, all governments in India irrespective of their political affiliation has addressed this problem aggressively and have devoted tremendous efforts and resources for the last 60 years in this area. The government has long back recognized that the stabilization of the population is not a stand alone issue but is an integral part of general human development strategy which takes into account social, health and educational conditions. Despite the numerous resources deployed for health and development, India continued to have one of the most rapidly growing population in the world. We were just 350 million at the time of independence and now increased to 1.15 billion. Our expected population in 2030 will be 1.53 billion, which will be the largest in the world of a single country.</p>
<p>This forum was&nbsp;an excellent opportunity for various government officers and member corporates from the national level and the states of UP, MP, Bihar, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Assam and Orissa to join in the deliberations and to understand the issues related to Population Stabilisation in the country. They also have an opportunity to interact with health officers from the states to discuss the way forward in their states and areas of possible collaboration. The issue of Population, Health and Development, is not limited to the health sector alone. It impacts all aspects of development and the economic development of the country at large and therefore would be a cause of concern and interest for all members. The Conference was well attended by 140 delegates from all over India.</p>
