There is a restless tide of infectious diseases. The <b>Second Annual Symposium,</b> therefore, focused on the role of molecular biology and molecular genetics in mankind's struggle against infectious diseases and hence entitled as <b>"Microbial Threats to Health in 21st Century"</b>. The Symposium was held on January 22, 1996 at the National Institute of Immunology, New Delhi. Eighteen eminent scientists, engaged in research in this area presented their work. The <b>Chief Guest, Prof. Myron E. Essex, Chairman, Harvard AIDS Institute and the Department of Cancer Biology, The Harvard Institute of Public Health, USA,</b> delivered the key note address entitled "The AIDS Virus: A Continuing Challenge". Two hundred and fifty scientists attended this Symposium. The proceedings of this symposium were published and formally released for distribution by Dr. Charles R. Scriver, Professor of Paediatrics and Human Genetics, McGill University, Montreal, Canada, at a special function organized in New Delhi, on December 3, 1996.

The theme for this year's symposium is&nbsp;<strong>"Therapeutic Antibodies"</strong>, the advent of which has revolutionized the treatment modalities for therapy of various chronic and morbid diseases like Rheumatoid Arthritis &amp; Cancer. The symposium was organized by Dr. O.P.Sood of Ranbaxy Science Foundation. The scientific program of the symposium was moderated by Prof. G.P. Talwar, of Talwar Research Foundation.<br><br>Antibodies are mixture of closely related immune system proteins which are produced in the blood to recognize and bind to foreign invaders, singling them out for elimination by body's defense mechanism. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are antibodies produced by a single white blood cell, making them specific and selective tools for therapeutic development. In other words, mAbs are analogous to guided missiles, always homing in on a specific target.<br><br>The keynote address in this years symposium"&nbsp;<strong>Bench to bedside : Anti TNF. A paradigm for biological targeted therapy" has been delivered by Prof. Ravinder N Maini, Head, Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology Division, Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine, London.</strong>&nbsp;Prof. Maini was awarded the prestigious Craford prize (Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences) along with Prof. Marc Feldmann for their groundbreaking work in developing new therapies for the treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Prof. Maini has been the pioneer in identification of TNF blockade as an effective therapeutic principle in Rheumatoid Arthritis.<br><br>The symposium was also addressed by pioneer scientists from abroad including Prof. T.K.S. Mukkur (Australia) and Prof. Rainer Fischer (Germany) covering a wide range of topics from the use of antibodies in Inflammation, Infectious diseases and their production. Renowned scientists from India including Prof. G.P Talwar, Dr.Satish Gupta, Prof. Ashok Kumar, Prof. Ramnath Misra, Dr. A.N.

Prasad Eye Institute, Hyderabad on March 5, 2005. Eminent doctors from all over India and abroad working in the area of stem cell research were invited to deliberate on their research work. The purpose of the symposium on this hot topic was to get together some of the leading stem cell researchers of the country to review the present status of research in this field in the country. The main topics covered in the symposium included Stem Cell technology in ophthalmology, the whys and hows of stem cell research in India, Asrij, a Novel Marker for ES Cells, Understanding the Mechanisms of Carcinogenesis using Cancer Stem Cells as a Model System, Investigation of early Cardiomyogenesis and Neutogenesis using ES Cell Model, Arrest, Release and Re-incarnation : Muscle Stem Cells and Tissue Repair, Hematopoietic Stem Cells : Beyond Hematopoietic Reconstitution etc. Stem cells offer the promise of a new regenerative medicine in which the damaged adult cells can be replaced with new cells, which offers the hope of restoration of cellular function and relief from suffering associated with many disabling disorders. Beyond tissue repair cultured stem cells lines also offer unprecedented opportunities for drug screening of assays and as vehicles for gene therapy. Each potential use of stem cells promises revolutionary advances. The key-note address&nbsp;<strong>"Mesenchymal Stem Cells and their Differentiation"</strong>&nbsp;was delivered by the Chief Guest Prof. Paul Simmons, Peter MacCallum Research Institute, Australia.
